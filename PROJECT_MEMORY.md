# Project Memory: Government ID Verification with DeepAgents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE ANY ACTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ANTI-REGRESSION PROTOCOLS
**NEVER CHICKEN OUT**: When facing implementation challenges, FIX THE ISSUE, don't switch to easier alternatives
**NO SUBPAR CODE**: If code quality is poor, REFACTOR IT, don't abandon for different approach
**STICK TO THE PATH**: Follow the defined architecture (4-agent DeepAgent + LangGraph), don't deviate to "simpler" solutions
**COMPLETE BEFORE SWITCHING**: Finish current implementation fully before considering alternatives
**HUMAN INSTRUCTIONS OVERRIDE**: When user provides specific technical direction, follow it exactly - don't second-guess

### CONTEXT POISONING PREVENTION (Human Layer Best Practices)
**Context Window Management**: Keep context 40-60% utilized, compact when approaching limits
**Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement**: Always follow this sequence, don't skip planning phase
**Frequent Compaction**: Summarize progress and eliminate incorrect information regularly
**Structured Tool Use**: Convert natural language to precise, structured tool calls
**State Management**: Maintain clear execution state, enable pause/resume workflows
**Error Compaction**: When errors occur, compact them into context and continue fixing

### CODING QUALITY REFERENCE
**Critique Agent Analysis**: ./CODING_MISTAKES_MADE.md contains systematic analysis of implementation failures
**When to Reference**:
- Before writing any new scripts or functions
- When stuck on implementation problems
- When user points out coding issues
- When tempted to create "quick solutions"
**Key Rule**: Fix existing code before writing new code

### FORBIDDEN PATTERNS TO AVOID
‚ùå "This is too complex, let me try a simpler approach"
‚ùå "The current code has issues, let me start over with different architecture"
‚ùå "Maybe we should use X instead of Y" (when Y was specifically requested)
‚ùå Switching from DeepAgents to single agent due to "complexity"
‚ùå Abandoning LangGraph for "simpler" orchestration
‚ùå Using mock/fake implementations instead of real integrations

### CRITICAL FAILURE PATTERN - NEVER REPEAT
üö® **EMPIRICAL FRAUD PATTERN (2025-09-21)**:
‚ùå **NEVER present simulated results as empirical evidence**
‚ùå **NEVER claim "excellent empirical results" when testing only mock data**
‚ùå **NEVER use confidence scores from simulations as real performance metrics**
‚ùå **ALWAYS distinguish between architecture validation and performance validation**
‚ùå **ALWAYS specify exactly what was tested (mock vs real data)**

**What happened**: Presented "85% agent workflow success" as empirical when it was pure simulation
**Real testing**: 3 mock images, 0 real government IDs, multiple tool failures
**Lesson**: Architecture can be sound while tool integration fails - be honest about both

### DYNAMIC MEMORY UPDATES
**Memory Source**: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md is SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
**Update Trigger**: Reference comprehensive specs before any major decision
**Validation Check**: Ensure all implementations align with detailed specifications
**Progress Tracking**: Update PROJECT_MEMORY.md with lessons learned and progress markers

## Core Architecture Pattern [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#agent-architecture]

### DeepAgent System (4 Core Agents)
1. **PreprocessAgent**: OpenCV document cleanup
2. **ExtractAgent**: Multi-modal extraction (OCR/MRZ/PDF417)
3. **ChecksAgent**: Rules validation and cross-verification
4. **CriticAgent**: LLM-powered traceability verification

### Key Design Principles
- **YAML-Driven Controls**: Vendor-neutral standards mapping
- **Zero Training**: All pretrained models and turnkey components
- **Standards-Aligned**: NIST/ICAO/AAMVA/ISO compliance framework
- **Traceability Matrix**: Control ‚Üí Tool ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Pass/Fail audit trail

---

## Technical Stack [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#bill-of-materials]

### Primary Components (Proven, Production-Ready)
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph + DeepAgents pattern
- **OCR**: PaddleOCR (primary), MMOCR (alternative)
- **MRZ Processing**: PassportEye (`read_mrz(...).to_dict()`)
- **PDF417 Decoding**: zxing-cpp + AAMVA parser
- **Face Matching**: InsightFace/DeepFace with pretrained models
- **Tamper Detection**: TruFor + ManTraNet (optional)
- **Document Preprocessing**: OpenCV corner detection + 4-point transform

### Installation Requirements
```bash
pip install langgraph passporteye zxing-cpp paddleocr insightface opencv-python
```

---

## Standards Compliance Framework [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#standards-framework]

### Required Standards Alignment
- **NIST SP 800-63-4** (Identity Proofing) - *Use 63-4, NOT 63-3*
- **ICAO Doc 9303** (MRZ layout + check-digit rules)
- **AAMVA DL/ID Standard 2025** (PDF417 + field specs)
- **ISO/IEC 30107-3** (PAD methodology)

### YAML Control Crosswalk Pattern
```yaml
standards:
  - id: ICAO_9303_P3_MRZ_CHECK
    requires: ["mrz_checksum_valid", "mrz_format_ok"]
    toolchain: ["passport_eye.mrz_extract", "passport_eye.checksum"]
    evidence: ["image_front.png"]
```

---

## Legal & Compliance Requirements [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#legal-compliance]

### Mandatory Language Patterns
- ‚úÖ "standards-**aligned**" NOT "compliant"
- ‚úÖ "research prototype" NOT "production system"
- ‚úÖ "implements checks consistent with" NOT "meets/complies with"

### Required Legal Boilerplate
> *This is a research prototype that demonstrates a standards-aligned verification workflow. It implements checks consistent with NIST SP 800-63-4, applies MRZ rules from ICAO Doc 9303, parses PDF417 per AAMVA guidance, and illustrates PAD reporting terminology from ISO/IEC 30107-3. It is not a certified system; no claim of formal compliance is made.*

## Previous Learning & Avoided Approaches

### What FAILED (Don't Repeat)
- ‚ùå DeepSeek R1 + Ollama: Timeout issues with batch processing
- ‚ùå Fake LangGraph agents: Rule-based keyword matching disguised as AI
- ‚ùå Text-only fraud detection: Too narrow for government ID verification

### What WORKS (Build Upon)
- ‚úÖ LangGraph orchestration framework
- ‚úÖ Real LLM API integration (OpenAI/Claude)
- ‚úÖ Structured output parsing from AI responses
- ‚úÖ Standards-based validation approaches

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### Agent Specialization Strategy
**PreprocessAgent**: Computer vision (OpenCV) - deterministic, fast
**ExtractAgent**: Multiple pre-trained models (OCR/MRZ/PDF417) - parallel processing
**ChecksAgent**: Rule-based validation (checksums, dates, formats) - deterministic
**CriticAgent**: LLM reasoning (completeness, terminology) - adaptive intelligence

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Raw ID Image ‚Üí Preprocess ‚Üí Extract (OCR/MRZ/PDF417) ‚Üí Rules Validation ‚Üí Critic Review ‚Üí Traceability Matrix
```

### Output Requirements [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#technical-implementation]
1. **Machine-readable**: `verification.jsonl` with control IDs
2. **Human report**: PDF with NIST/ICAO/AAMVA sections
3. **Transparency appendix**: Tool versions, config hash, seeds

## Critical Implementation Notes

### License Considerations [Reference: COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md#agent-architecture]
- InsightFace: Specific license terms - verify for commercial use
- TruFor/ManTraNet: Domain gap - use as signals, not sole deciders
- All OSS components: Maintain attribution and license compliance

### Technical Gotchas
- **PDF417**: Prefer zxing-cpp (ZBar doesn't handle PDF417)
- **Standards Currency**: Always reference NIST 800-63-**4** (Aug 2025)
- **Check-digit Validation**: Show actual computation, not just pass/fail

### Deployment Considerations
- FastAPI + LangGraph template for production readiness
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Langfuse integration for observability and metrics

---

## Project Differentiation

### From Previous Marketplace Fraud Work
- **Multi-modal**: Images + documents vs text-only
- **Regulated Domain**: Government standards vs ad-hoc fraud patterns
- **Compliance Focus**: Audit trails vs simple classification
- **Production Grade**: Real standards alignment vs proof-of-concept

### From Traditional ML Approaches
- **Modular Architecture**: Swappable agents vs monolithic models
- **Standards-Driven**: YAML configuration vs hardcoded features
- **Adaptive Planning**: LLM reasoning vs fixed pipelines
- **Vendor Neutral**: OSS components vs proprietary solutions

## üîÑ DYNAMIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Automatic Reference Protocol
**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**: Must reference COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md sections:
- `#bill-of-materials` ‚Üí For tool selection and integration
- `#standards-framework` ‚Üí For compliance requirements
- `#technical-implementation` ‚Üí For architecture decisions
- `#legal-compliance` ‚Üí For language and documentation
- `#agent-architecture` ‚Üí For system design patterns

### Memory Sync Mechanism
**Validation Checklist** (Run before major decisions):
- [ ] Current approach aligns with comprehensive specifications
- [ ] No shortcuts or "simpler" alternatives being considered
- [ ] All OSS components from approved bill of materials
- [ ] Standards compliance language follows legal guidelines
- [ ] Agent architecture follows DeepAgent + LangGraph pattern

### Context Compaction Triggers (HumanLayer ACE-FCA Method)
**Compact when**:
- Context utilization > 60% (optimal: 40-60%)
- Error patterns repeat > 3 times
- Implementation deviates from specifications
- Alternative approaches being considered
- Raw logs exceed 5 bullets per error

**ACE-FCA Compaction Process**:
1. **File-Scoped Context Assembly**: Include only relevant files + direct deps + nearest tests
2. **Error Compaction**: Max 5 bullets per failure (root cause + minimal fix + result)
3. **State Preservation**: Keep durable state, eliminate raw logs
4. **Session Boundaries**: Compress old details, maintain fresh context
5. **Spec Synchronization**: Update SPEC_SHA hash when comprehensive specs change

**File-Context Assembly Rules**:
- **Include**: Files being edited + direct imports + nearest tests
- **Exclude**: Generated/vendor/lock files; dedupe near-duplicates
- **Cap**: Target 40-60% context utilization
- **Rank**: By path proximity, commit recency, test coverage

### Quality Assurance Gates
**Gate 1**: YAML crosswalk must reference exact standards from specifications
**Gate 2**: OSS installations must match approved component list
**Gate 3**: Agent implementation must follow 4-agent DeepAgent pattern
**Gate 4**: All outputs must include standards-compliant legal language
**Gate 5**: No mock/fake implementations allowed - real integrations only

### Regression Detection Patterns
**RED FLAGS** that indicate regression:
- Considering "mock" implementations instead of real integrations
- Suggesting architectural changes to "simplify" the system
- Avoiding specific requirements due to "complexity"
- Switching tools not in the approved bill of materials
- Using non-standards-compliant language in outputs

### Recovery Protocol When Regression Detected
1. **STOP** current approach immediately
2. **REFERENCE** COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md
3. **IDENTIFY** which specification section applies
4. **REALIGN** implementation with original requirements
5. **CONTINUE** with correct approach, no shortcuts
